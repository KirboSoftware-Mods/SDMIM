# Stop Doxxing My Ip Minecraft

Just a simple server side mod that adds a mixin to hide your IP when joining a server with this mod installed. 

## Why making this?
In this day and age where your IP is open in the wild (in logging or whatever) could be used maliciously by the wrong people. 

This is more a privacy feature in the server logging to prevent you from being doxxed and that's it. I feel personally this should've been done a long while ago as server admins don't need to know a players IP address when joining a server (At least in my opinion)
